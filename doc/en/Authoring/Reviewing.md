# Reviewing

Computer aided assessment of mathematics works in the following phases.

1. [Authoring](../Authoring/index.md),
2. [Testing](Testing.md) and
3. [Deploying](Deploying.md) questions.
4. [Adding questions to a quiz](Quiz.md) and use by students.
5. [Reviewing](Reviewing.md) and statistical analysis.

Reviewing students' answers closes the learning cycle for teachers by allowing them to understand what students are doing. Basic reviewing is undertaken through the Moodle quiz.  For example, lists of scores etc. are available there.  The Moodle quiz also calculates basic statistics based on the numerical information.

To review work we need to use two important parts of the question. Please read the following two entries before continuing with this article.

* The [question note](Question_note.md).
* The [answer note](Potential_response_trees.md#Answer_note).

## Individual item analysis ##

To access the quiz reports you need to look in the Moodle navigation block. Under the quiz, select Results then STACK response analysis.  The reports do the following

* Analysis of each item as a whole.  This combines all the [answer notes](Potential_response_trees.md#Answer_note) from each deployed version and each attempt.  We list by the whole answer note (route through the potential response tree) and list by split answer notes, which give the occurances of each outcome.  The precise details of the question dictate the relative importance of these two sets of data.
* List of all answers to each version, orderd by frequency and highlighting invalid answers.
