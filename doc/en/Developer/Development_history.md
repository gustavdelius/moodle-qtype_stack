# History of previous versions of STACK

For current and future plans, see [Development track](Development_track.md) and [Future plans](Future_plans.md).

STACK is a direct development of the CABLE project which ran at the University of Birmingham. CABLE was a development of the AiM computer aided assessment system.

## Version 3.0

Released September 2012.

Major re-engineering of the code by the Open University, The  University of Birmingham and the University of Helsinki.  Reporting and documentation added by Ben Holmes.

The most important change is the decision to re-work STACK as a question type for the Moodle quiz.  There is no longer a separate front end for STACK, or (currently) a mechanism to include STACK questions into other websites via a SOAP webservice. This round of development does not plan to introduce major new features, or to make major changes to the core functionality. An explicit aim is that "old questions will still work".

Key features

* __Major difference:__ Integration into the quiz of Moodle 2.3 as a question type.
* Support for Maxima up to 5.28.0.
* Documentation moved from the wiki to within the code base.
* Move from CVS to GIT.

### Changes in features between STACK 2 and STACK 3.

* Key-val pairs, i.e. Question variables and feedback variables, now use Maxima's assignment syntax, e.g. `n:5` not the oldstyle `n=5`.  The importer automtically converts old questions to this new style.
* Interaction elements, now called inputs, are indicated in questions as `[[input:ans1]]` to match the existing style in Moodle.  Existing questions will be converted when imported.
* A number of other terminology changes have brought STACK's use into line with Moodle's, e.g. Worked solution has changed to "general feedback".
* Change in the internal name of one answer test `Equal_Com_ASS` changed to `EqualComASS`.
* Feature "allowed words" dropped from inputs (i.e. interaction elements).
* JSMath is no longer under development, and hence we are no longer providing an option for this in STACK.  However, in STACK 2 we modified JSMath to enable inputs within equations.  Display now assumes the use of a Moodle filter and we recommend (and test with) MathJax, which does not currently support this feature.  If it is important for you to use this feature you will need to copy and modify the load.js file from STACK 2 and use JSMath.
* Worked solution on demand feature has been removed.  This was a hack in STACK 2, and the use of Moodle quiz has made this unnecessary.
* Some options are no longer needed.  This functionality is now handelled by the "behaviours", so are uncecessary in STACK 3.
 * The "Feedback used".
 * The "Mark modification".
* We have lost some of the nice styling on the editing form, compared to Stack 2.
* Answer tests no longer return a numerical mark, hence the "+AT" option for mark modification method has been dropped.
* The STACK maxima function `filter` has been removed.  It should be replaced by the internal Maxima function `sublist`.  Note, the order of the arguments is reversed!
* The maxima libraries `powers` and `format` have been removed.
* We now strongly discourage the use of dollar symbols for denoting LaTeX mathematics environments.  See the pages on [mathjax](MathJax.md#delimiters) for more information on this change.
* The expessions supplied by the question author as question tests are no longer simplified at all.  See the entry on [question tests](../Authoring/Testing.md#Simplification).

Things we intend to do.

* Input "Dropdown" list -> should be automatically imported to "list". This whole input type needs refactoring.


## Version 2.2

Released: October 2010 session.

* Enhanced reporting features.
* Enhanced question management features in Moodle.  E.g. [import multiple questions](https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=2930512&group_id=119224&atid=683351)
  from AiM/Maple TA at once, assign multiple questions to Moodle question banks.
* Slider interaction elements.

## Version 2.1

Developed by Chris Sangwin and Simon Hammond at the University of Birmingham.
Released: Easter 2010 session.

Key features

* [Precision](../Authoring/Answer_tests.md#Precision) answer test added to allow significant to be checked.
* [Form](../Authoring/Answer_tests.md#Form) answer test added to test if an expression is in completed square form.
* List interaction element expanded to include checkboxes.  See [List](../Authoring/Inputs.md#List).
* Move to Maxima's `random()` function, rather then generate our own pseudo random numbers
* [Conditionals in CASText](https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=2888054&group_id=119224&atid=683351)
* Support for Maxima 5.20.1
* New option added: OptWorkedSol.  This allows the teacher to decide whether the tick box to request the worked solution is available.
* Sample resources included as part of the FETLAR project.


## Version 2.0

Released, September 2007.  Developed by Jonathan Hart and Chris Sangwin at the University of Birmingham.

Key features

* Display of mathematics taken care of by JSMath.
* Integrated into Moodle.
* Variety of interaction elements.
* Multi-part questions.
* Cache.
* Item tests.

### Version 1.0

Released, 2005.  Developed by Chris Sangwin at the University of Birmingham.
